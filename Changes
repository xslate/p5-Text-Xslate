Revision history for Perl extension Text::Xslate

{{$NEXT}}
    [CHANGES]
    - Portions of Text::Xslate guts have been ripped out of Xslate.pm and
      have been moved to Text::Xslate::Loader and Text::Xslate::Loader::File.
      By providing your own Loader class, you will be able to load templates
      from a database, and cache them in Memcached, for example.
      See example/loader.pl for an exampl using SQLite + Memcached (lestrrat)
    - Some parts were moved into Text::Xslate::Assembler (lestrrat)
    - File-based caches are now stored in directory names containing the
      byte code version (lestrrat)
    - Bump up the byte code version. The new byte code now has a "meta"
      opcode that can contain arbitrary information on the generated
      bytecode, such as "utf8" flag (which previously was part of the
      cached byte code /file/, but not part of the bytecode) (lestrrat)
    - Error generation has been refactored into a role (lestrrat)
    - The default cache directory, previously located under 
        $ENV{HOME}/.xslate_cache
      has been moved to 
        "$ENV{TEMPDIR}/xslate_cache/$>"
      If $ENV{TEMPDIR} is empty, File::Spec->tmpdir is used.
    - Pure-Perl version of Text::Xslate have been ripped out, and is no
      longer supported (tokuhirom)
    - The distribution is now based on Minilla (tokuhirom)

      2 times faster than PP::Opcode (according to benchmark/x-poor-env.pl)

    [BUG FIXES]
    * Modulus zero ($foo % 0) could throw uncatchable errors

    [FEATURES]

        print $tx->render('bar.tx', \%vars);
