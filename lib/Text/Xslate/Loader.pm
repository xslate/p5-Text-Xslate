=head1 NAME

Text::Xslate::Loader - Loader Base Class

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Text::Xslate::Loader is a base class for Loader classes, but it doesn't do
much by itself. You are also NOT REQUIRED to inherit from this class to make
your own Loader: You just need to provide a "load()" method for it to work.
This class is here because there are a few initialization-related methods
that are mostly common for Loaders.

=head1 CREATING YOUR LOADER

Text::Xslate by default takes a class name as loader and instantiates it
but if you are building a new loader we recommend you don't rely on this
feature.

Instead, instantiate an object yourself and pass it to Text::Xslate:

    Text::Xslate->new(
        loader => MyAwesome::Loader->new()
    );

Your Loader class may need some configuration using the main Text::Xslate
object instance. For that, provide a method named C<configure()>:

    sub configure {
        my ($loader, $engine) = @_;
        # Make whatever necessary change to $loader using $engine
    }
