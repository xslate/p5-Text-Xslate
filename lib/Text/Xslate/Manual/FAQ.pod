Text::Xslate::Manual::FAQ - Frequently asked questions and answers

=head1 QUESTIONS

=head2 General

=head3 How do you pronounce Xslate?

We read it C</eks-leit/>.

=head3 What Xslate stands for?

It stands for I<XS template>, a template engine written in XS, although
pure Perl implementations are also provided.

=head3 What are 'Kolon', 'Metakolon', and 'TTerse' ?

Xslate supports multiple template syntaxes. Kolon is the default syntax,
Metakolon is suitable to output Kolon templates, and TTerse is compatible
with Template-Toolkit. You can specify the template syntax by passing
C<syntax> option to the Text::Xslate constructor.

    my $tx = Text::Xslate->new(
        syntax => 'TTerse', # by moniker
    );

    my $tx = Text::Xslate->new(
        syntax => 'Text::Xslate::Syntax::TTerse', # by fully qualified name
    );

=head3 What version of perl does Xslate require?

Xslate is tested on perl v5.8.1. No special settings should be required.

=head3 Optimizations Employed By Text::Xslate

Here are some optimizations worth noting that makes Text::Xslate run so fast,
in no particular order:

=over

=item Pre-Compiled Templates

Text::Xslate is among the template engines that pre-compile the templates.
This is similar to, say, Template::Toolkit, but Text::Xslate compiles the
templates to C structures and stores them as binary data.

=item Built On Top Of A Virtual Machine

Text::Xslate is built on top of virtual machine that executes bytecode, and
this virtual machine is fine-tuned I<specifically> for template processing.

The virtual machine also employs optimizations such as direct-threading
style coding to shave off any extra milliseconds that the engine might take
otherwise

=item Custom Byte Codes For Oft-Used Operations

Some operations which are used very often are optimized into its own
byte code. For example (as described elsewhere) Text::Xslate automatically
escapes HTML unless you tell it not to. Text::Xslate implements this process
which involves escaping the string I<while> appending the result to the
output buffer in C, as a custom byte code. This lets you avoid the penalties
usually involved in such operations.

=item Pre-Allocation Of Output Buffers

One of the main things to consider to reduce performance degradation
while processing a template is to avoid the number of calls to C<malloc()>.
One of the tricks that Text::Xslate employs to reduce the number of calls to
C<malloc()> is to pre-allocate the output buffer in an intelligent manner:
For example, Text::Xslate assumes that most templates will be rendered to be
about the same as the previous run, so when a template is rendered it uses
the size allocated for the previous rendering as an approximation of how much
space the current rendering will require. This allows to greatly reduce the
number of C<malloc()> calls required to render a template.

=head2 Templates

=head3 How can I changes template tags?

Use C<start_tag>, C<end_tag>, and C<line_start> options to C<new> method,
which can be joined together with C<syntax> option:

    my $tx = Text::Xslate->new(
        syntax     => 'TTerse',
        tag_start  => '{',
        tag_end    => '}',
        line_start => undef,
    );
    print $tx->render_string('Hello, {lang} world!', { lang => 'Xslate' });

=head3 How can I iterate over HASH references?

Convert HASH references into ARRAY references because C<for> methods can deal
with ARRAY references.

    : # in Kolon
    : # iterate $hash by keys
    : for $hash.keys() -> $key {
        <: $key :>
    : }
    : # by values
    : for $hash.values() -> $value {
        <: $value :>
    : }
    : # by key-value pairs
    : for $hash.kv() -> $pair {
        <: $pair.key :>=<: $pair.value :>
    : }

Note that the above methods return ARRAY references sorted by the keys.

=head3 How can I use Template-Toolkit virtual methods and filters?

Xslate itself does not support these methods and filters, but there
are modules on CPAN that implement them.

L<Text::Xslate::Bridge::TT2> provides almost all the TT methods and filters,
but it requires Template-Toolkit installed.

L<Text::Xslate::Bridge::TT2Like> provides the same features as
C<T::X::Bridge::TT2>, but it does not require the Template-Toolkit distribution.

These bridge modules are useful not only for TTerse users, but
also for Kolon users.

=head3 How can I (write|get) plugins?

It is unlikely to write plugins for Xslate, because Xslate allows
you to export any functions to templates. Any function-based modules
are available by the C<module> option to the C<new> method.

Xslate also allows to call methods for object instances, so you can
use any object-oriented modules, except for classes which only provide
class methods (they need wrappers).

If you want to add methods to builtin data types (nil, scalars, arrays and
hashes), you can write bridge modules. See L<Text::Xslate::Bridge> for details.

=head3 How to limit while-loop like Template-Toolkit?

While Template-Toolkit has a loop counter to prevent runaway WHILE loop,
Xslate has no arbitrary limitation.

Instead, you can use C<alarm()> to limit B<any> runaway code:

    eval {
        local $SIG{ALRM} = sub { die @_ };
        alarm(1); # set timeout
        $tx->render('<: while true { } :>', \%vars);
    };
    if($@ =~ /\b ALRM \b/xms) {
        # timeout!
    }

=head3 Does Xslate process text strings, or binary strings?
X<utf8> X<UTF-8> X<utf8 flagged string> X<unicode>

(The meaning of I<text string> and I<binary string> is that of Perl,
see L<perlunifaq>.)

Xslate assumes template files to be encoded in C<UTF-8> by default, so the
output is a text string and template parameters must be text strings.
However, if you want to process binary strings, you can do by passing C<:raw>
for C<input_encoding>.

=head2 Functions, filters and macros

=head3 How can I use macros as a callback to high-level functions?

Macros are objects that overload C<&{}>, the CODE dereference operator, so
all you have to do is to call them, but don't check their types because
they are not a I<real> CODE reference.

    my $tx = Text::Xslate->new(
        function => {
            count => sub {
                my($a, $cb) = @_;
                # Don't check the type of $cb!
                return scalar grep { $cb->($_) } @{$a};
            },
        },
    );

    print $tx->render_string('<: count($a, -> $x { $x >= 50 }) :>',
        { a => [ 0 .. 100 ] },
    ); # => 50

=head2 Development

=head3 How can I colorize Xslate templates?

If you are a C<vim> user, there is F<xslate.vim> for Kolon:
L<https://github.com/motemen/xslate-vim>
